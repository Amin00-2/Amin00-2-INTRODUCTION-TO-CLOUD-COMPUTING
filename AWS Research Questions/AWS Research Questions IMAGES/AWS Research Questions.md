Basic Cloud Architecture Diagram

![alt text](e2.png)


Description of Each Service & Interaction
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - Networking Layer

A VPC provides an isolated network for AWS resources.

The VPC Subnet contains compute resources like EC2 instances.

The Internet Gateway (IGW) allows public access to resources.

Compute (EC2 Instance) - Web Server

An EC2 instance runs applications (e.g., a web server like Apache, Nginx).

It interacts with S3 for static content like images, videos, and backups.

It is accessible via a Load Balancer for distributing traffic.

Storage (S3 Bucket) - Object Storage

S3 stores website assets, logs, and backups.

EC2 retrieves static files (e.g., CSS, images) from S3 to serve web pages.

S3 provides high availability and durability for stored objects.

Load Balancer (Optional for Scaling)

If multiple EC2 instances exist, an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes traffic evenly.

Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

How Services Interact:
A user requests a web page via the internet.

The request is routed through the Load Balancer to an EC2 instance.

The EC2 instance processes the request and fetches dynamic content.

If needed, EC2 retrieves static assets (images, videos) from S3.

The EC2 instance returns the response to the user.
